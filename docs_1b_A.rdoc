The docs say:

    TESTOPTS      :: Deprecated, same as A
    FILTER        :: Deprecated, same as A

But they are different, its not just a renaming, so its not the "same as". How they are used is different. Instead write:

    TESTOPTS      :: Deprecated, use A instead
    FILTER        :: Deprecated, use A instead
